    <p>Hello, My name is Michael Edelstein. I was born Novemeber 23rd 1986 in Queens NY. When I was three my parents
        moved to Marlboro New Jersey for the excellent school systems. I attended Marlboro High School and moved to
        Florida after graduating. I attended Broward County community college for 2 semesters before moving back to New
        Jersey. I then enrolled in Brookdale Community College. After working in retail and sales for 15 years I decided
        to chnage the direction of my life. I'm currently a student in a Full stack coding bootcamp adminstered through
        Rutgers University. My gaol is to learn and, eventually, master Web Development.
    </p>
